                        "Boxing breaks many of the binaries that men are conditioned to believe about our bodies, our genders, ourselves. With its cover of 'realness' and violence, it provides room for what so many men lack: tenderness, and touch, and vulnerability." - Thomas McBee, <em>Amateur: A True Story About What Makes a Man</em>

                        "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion, and danger." - M.F.K. Fischer, <em>Consider the Oyster</em>

                        "If, one day, a milky portal had opened up in your bedroom and an older version of yourself had stepped out and told you what you know now, would you have listened?" - Carmen Maria Machado, <em>In the Dream House: A Memoir</em>

                        "And then for a while I'm not sure if I am inside the universe or the universe is inside me. The only thing that seems for sure is that somewhere in all the dancing around of whatever it is that dances, there's a human-shape of me, with either everything inside of it or it is inside of everything, or somehow - don't ask me how - both at the same time." - Lisa Bunker, <em>Felix Yz</em>

                        "To ask 'What's good?' was to move, right away, to joy. It was pushing aside what was inevitable to reach the exceptional. Not great or well or wonderful, but simply good. Because good was more often enough, was a precious spark we sought and harvested of and for one another." - Ocean Vuong, <em>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</em>

                        "I am living in the most opportune time in black history in the United States and that means, still, that I will die younger, live poorer, risk more exposure to police violence, and be punished by social policy for being a black woman in ways that arenâ€™t true for almost any other group in this nation. That is the best it has ever been to be black in America and it is still that statistically bad at the macro level." - Tressie McMillan Cottom, <em>Thick</em>
